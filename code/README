  This subdirectory contains 2 programs for calculating the bottom elevation
  as a function of time. Both programs set the acceleration and terminal velocity
  of the elliptical slider for one of the experiments. The programs contain a
  driver program that calls a subroutine that could be included in an arbitrary
  hydrodynamics program.
  
  Program Slider_geometry85.f90 calculates the bottom elevation for an elliptical
  slider that replicates the laboratory experiment.
  
  Program Slider_geometry86.f90 is similar but smoothes the ends of the slider
  for depth-averaged non-hydrostatic simulators or other codes as required.
