# Tsunami_Generation_Benchmark
This repository contains documentation, data, and results from the laboratory experiments conducted by Colin Whittaker at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
This experiment addresses tsunami generation by a semi-elliptical block moving along a horizontal boundary at the base of a long narrow wave flume. The data are intended for use as a benchmark for numerical models.
The repository is organised into a documentation directory that contains a PhD thesis and relevant papers, a data directory that contains a sample grid and slider location specifications, and a results directory that contains time-series and spatial data for use in model comparisons.
